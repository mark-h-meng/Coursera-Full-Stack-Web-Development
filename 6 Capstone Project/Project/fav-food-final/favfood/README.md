Hi Guys, 

This folder is the root directory of the Capstone project.
All source code files are included.
There are some key files/codes:


(1) public/index.html -- this file contains all key front-end design

(2) server.js -- the AngularJS routing implementation

(3) public/controllers/controller.js -- this files is responsible for the back-end implementation.


Thanks for your review.

Regards,

Mark
