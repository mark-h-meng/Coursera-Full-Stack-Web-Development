# fav.food

*A web app for your food choice in campus*

## Introduction

This is an idea to develop a web app for the staff & students of my university to browse and vote for the food selling in campus. By introducing this service, all the customer within campus, regardless of students, staff or visitors, can benefit from it to know the best seller and most popular food within campus area. Moreover, users are enabled to share with the latest promotion event on our website so that other users can also know get informed in time.

## Features

Besides the list of different food stalls & pictures which are created & uploaded by user, the web app also enable user to vote (like) for their favorite food. The vote number of a food stall will be displayed in public so that all users could know the top ranked food in the campus at real time. 

#### Implementation Techniques

The entire web app may use a bootstrap theme [1] & angularJS for the frontend design, and using nodeJS and mongoDB for the backend implementation -- thus it will be an good exercise for the knowledge learnt from this specialization.

#### List of Features

The features of fav.food could be summarized as below:

## Market Survey

The first phrase of this web app development will focus on a small area and serve a limited group of people. It will be unique service and a good complementary to the other large scale of food review applications such as *Yelp*, *HungryGoWhere* or *OpenRice* [2-5] - it has **higher accuracy** in serving users and it will be a very **lightweight web service**.
